# Algoritmer

My assignments and code written for the Ã…bo Akademi's course in algorithms

## Assignment 1

Generating a Labyrinth using a Union/Find algorithm, the default value is 100*100 cells but any size between 2-100 can be used.

## Assignment 2

Creating a graph from a text document and sorting it using a TopSort algorithm.

## Assignment 3

Creating a graph by linking together words that differ by exactly one character, and then finding the shortest path from one word to another in the graph by using Dijkstra's algorithm

## Assignment 4

Tic-Tac-Toe game that uses a min max algorithm to choose the next move for the computer. Good luck trying to beat it, it is quite impossible.
